# Open Data

A collection of datasets I have generated from which I think the public could benefit. All the datasets fall under the MIT license so can be used in any way you see fit. If you create any projects using the datasets below, please get in touch with me at reuben.thorpe.work@gmail.com as I would love to hear about it.
